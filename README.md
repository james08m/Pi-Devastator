# Pi-Devastator __[PAUSED]__

__Pi-Devastator__ is a robotic project based on a __Raspberry Pi 4__ and developped mainly in __Python__ using the __RPi.GPIO__ and Pygame library. The  goal of this project is to control a DFRobot robot frame using a __Raspberry Pi 4__ and a Rii wireless keyboard. This is a good robot base and I will most likely be able to build further more on top of it in the futur. 

This project was inpired by Christopher Barnatt and his videos about his Pi Devastator Robot. I  guided myself with his videos for the electronic part, but the code here is much more advanced and efficient (In my opinion). Take a look at his channel Explaining Computers you will find a lot of interesting stuff and not necessary related to robots.
